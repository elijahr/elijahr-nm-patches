These are patches I composed for the Nord Modular synthesizer.

From the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Modular):

> [...] unlike most other analogue modelling synth hardware, which generally simulate one or a small number of (usually subtractive ) synth circuit layouts, the Nord Modular range approximates the much more flexible world of modular synthesizers, offering an almost unlimited variation of synth architectures, with the facility to simulate, in addition to subtractive synthesis, additive, FM, and, in the second generation of the series, physical modelling synthesis methods, as well as a number of other sound generation and processing techniques.
> Because of the flexibility offered by these synths, patches cannot be programmed from the controls on the units themselves. Patch editing is instead performed on a PC (connected via 2 dedicated MIDI ports in the case of the first generation and USB in the second generation or G2 systems), running editor software bundled with the synths.

I've worked on these patches off and on since about 2005.
